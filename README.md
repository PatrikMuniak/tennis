# Tennis Courts Booking Finder

Go to Map and select the courts you are interested in. You will see them selected in the Home page where you can filter out the bookings based of various criteria.

The app is comprised of two pages:

Map page: where the user can choose the tennis courts to view the bookings.

Homepage: where the user chan filter out the available slots for a set of tennis courts based on multiple criteria.

I havent used any ORM or frontend framework, just plain Python and JavaScript except for the use of Flask.
