let's say I add the possibility of adding multiple types to the DateTs value at that point:
if it's an integer or float I'll use the unix conversion 
if it's a string then convert it to just the string , but at this point I need to do a validation of the string
# if isinstance(date_ts, numbers.Number):
# elif isinstance(date_ts, str):
#     # this way devs can bypass and put any value
#     self._value = date_ts
For both cases I should check and try to set the value and trigger an exception or waring if I get an invalid input
